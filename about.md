Hi

I would like to think of myself as a software developer with strong inclinations towards building things that follow data-driven principles and are UX centric (like this website). I've recently stepped down from my position as Data Engineer at [RateGain](https://rategain.com) in order to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science. I was part of the Data Science Lab at RateGain for the entirety of my time there. I, along with the team worked on problems ranging from price optimizations, sentiment analysis to building custom algorithms for city demand forecasting. Prior to RateGain, I was an undergraduate at [Jamia Hamdard University](http://www.jamiahamdard.ac.in:81) in New Delhi from where I got my bachelors degree in Computer Science.

I love working on tools, infrastructure and working on scaling applications from the ground up. Occasional [Gopher](https://golang.org) and a full time [Pythonista](https://www.python.org) among other things. When not writing code, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), watching La Liga (Hala Madrid!), backpacking across the Indian subcontinent and outside of it once in a while. Have a weak spot for good music, standup comedy and theatre.
