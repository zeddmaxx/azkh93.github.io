## Hi. Iâ€™m Zoya!
I'm a senior at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, New Delhi, pursuing a Bachelors in Technology with a major in Information Technology. 
I absolutely adore Python and am currently fascinated by Neural Nets. I chill by reading mystery books and binging TV-Series! :P


That's all for now!


Thanks for stopping by, amigo! :D
