title: Hi. Iâ€™m Azhar.

<hr>

Hi, my name is **Azhar Khan**. I would like to describe myself as an individual possessing a fusion of skills in Software Engineering, DevOps and Data Science, coupled with strong inclination towards building things that are data-driven and UX centric (like this website).

I've recently stepped down from my position as Data Engineer at [RateGain](https://rategain.com) in order to pursue graduate studies. I was part of the Data Science Lab at RateGain for the entirety of my time there. I, along with the team worked on a diverse set of problems ranging from price optimizations techniques, sentiment analysis to building custom algorithms for city demand forecasting. Prior to RateGain, I was an undergraduate at [Jamia Hamdard University](http://www.jamiahamdard.ac.in:81) in New Delhi from where I got my bachelors degree in Computer Science.

I love working on tools, infrastructure and working on scaling applications from the ground up. Occasional [Gopher](https://golang.org) and a full time [Pythonista](https://www.python.org) among other things. When not writing code, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), watching La Liga (Hala Madrid!), backpacking across the Indian subcontinent and outside of it once in a while. I'm also an avid quizzer and occasionally brag about some trivia that no one seems to know about. Have a weak spot for good music, standup comedy and theatre.
